module Verification.Core.Category.Std.Category.ColimitIntroduction where

-- | A remarkable fact of mathematics is that some constructions
--   appear again and again in different contexts. Using category
--   theory it can be shown that these are all instances of the same
--   underlying concept. One such concept is that of colimits, of which
--   all the following definitions (initial object, coproduct, coequalizer) are examples.
--   By inverting the direction of all arrows in this chapter, one would arrive
--   at the dual concepts (terminal object, product, equalizer). But we present
--   only the former ones.
-- | The general idea is that all these objects are characterized by the fact
--   that they are in some way the most minimal object which fulfills some property in
--   a category.
