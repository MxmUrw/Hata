-- | Abstractly, first order terms are defined to
--   made up of free variables and function symbols.
--   Each function symbol has a finite number
--   of inputs and a single output. In the many sorted case
--   the inputs and outputs of a symbol carry a type (usually called a sort),
--   and only well-typed compositions are allowed.
--   The available sorts and function symbols for a particular
--   term system are succinctly given in a /signature/.

-- [Definition]
-- | A /signature for many sorted terms/,
--   which we call [..], is given by the following data.
record 𝒯FOSignature (𝑖 : 𝔏) : 𝒰 (𝑖 ⁺) where

  -- | 1. A type of sorts [..].
  field Sort : 𝒰 𝑖

  -- | 2. A parametrized type of function symbols, here called constructors, [...,]
  --      where |Con αs β| contains function symbols
  --      with input sorts |αs| and output sort |β|.
  field Con : List Sort -> Sort -> 𝒰 𝑖

  -- | 3. Proofs that those sets are discrete,
  --      i.e., have decidable equality.
  field {{isDiscrete:Sort}} : isDiscrete Sort
  field {{isDiscrete:Con}} : ∀{αs α} -> isDiscrete (Con αs α)
  field {{isSet-Str:Sort}} : isSet-Str Sort

-- #Notation/Rewrite# 𝒯FOSignature = Sig_{FO}

-- [Remark]
-- | The discreteness of the sort and constructor
--   types is required by unification, since the algorithm needs to
--   compare sorts and constructors when unifying terms. On the other hand,
--   no finiteness assumptions are neccessary.
