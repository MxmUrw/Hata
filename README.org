* Project Hata
** Goal
   The goal of this project is to formalize enough mathematics (category theory, algebra) to
   be able to do proper verified development of theoretical computer science, i.e., type theory,
   logic, algorithms, compilation.

   Currently, the focus is on creating a theory of type checking / type inference systems. It should
   include the full pipeline a real world programming language needs to have: from a collection of files
   in the file system via an interactive editor to an internal data type of well typed terms of that language.
   This means that a proper way to record errors, as well as information derived during the inference process
   will be a core part of the theory.

** Philosophy
   The philosophy of the formalization is that 3 aspects should be accommodated with as few
   compromises as possible:
    - The code should compile into a native binary.
    - The code should also be compilable into a pdf file, producing a mathematical document akin to the ones
      written by hand.
    - Finally the source files itself should remain humanly readable, i.e. all commentary intended for the pdf should
      be formatted without much syntactic overhead. This means that a markdown-like language is more preferrable
      than e.g. Tex.


** Current state
   In the following the current state of different features is shown.
   Explanation of the checkboxes:
   - [X] A checked box means that this topic is implemented.
     (with a certain amount of corresponding proofs which would usually be expected)
   - [ ] An unchecked box means that this topic is not implemented yet,
     but is considered for future implementation.
   - [ ] [REW/WIP] An unchecked box with an annotation means that this topic is currently in development (WIP), or that it
     once was implemented, but is currently pending a rewrite (REW) (being out of date because of rewrites in other places).
